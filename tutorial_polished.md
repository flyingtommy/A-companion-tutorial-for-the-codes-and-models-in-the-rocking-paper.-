# Tutorial: Reduced-Order Flexible Solid Modelling for Rocking Problems in Simulink

## Overview
This tutorial provides the MATLAB codes, the Simulink models, and the necessary introductions required to run the examples presented in the companion paper. Two examples from the companion paper are covered:

1. A realistic column-like structure  
2. A scaled frame structure used in a physical experiment  

The first example demonstrates how to use MATLAB and Simulink to conduct reduced-order analysis for rocking problems.  
The second example shows how to build a structural system with many inter-connected components in Simulink.

## Pre-requisites

Readers must have a good understanding of:

1. The **Craig-Bampton reduction method**.  
2. The **Floating Frame of Reference formulation**.
3. This well-written **[Simscape Example](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html)**.

### Suggested Readings
- The companion paper, which provides an introduction to both theories.  
- The paper **“[Coupling of Substructures for Dynamic Analyses](https://hal.science/hal-01537654v1/document)”**, which proposed the original Craig-Bampton method.  
- The paper **“[Primer on the Craig-Bampton](https://www.vibrationdata.com/tutorials2/Primer_on_the_Craig-Bampton_Method.pdf)”**, which provides a well-written introduction to the Craig-Bampton method, including checks to verify successful reduction and other practical tips.  
- **Chapter 5** in the book **“[Dynamics of Multibody Systems](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/dynamics-of-multibody-systems/E287DA737B6138E040AA96FC12F7D7DF#contents)”**, which proposes and elaborates on the floating frame of reference formulation.  

### Software requirements:

1. MATLAB 2023a or later version.
2. Simulink 2023a or later version.
3. MATLAB **[Partial Differential Equation Toolbox](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/pde.html)**.
4. Simulink extension **[Simscape Multibody](https://uk.mathworks.com/products/simscape-multibody.html)**.
5. OxContact library in Simscape.

## Why This Separate Documentation?
Although MATLAB provides the **[Simscape Example](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html)** for using the reduced order flexible solid, this separate documentation is necessary for the following reasons.

### 1. Additional functionalities not included in the Simscape Example
The provided codes add two important capabilities to MATLAB’s original implementation:

1. **Allows retention of any desired fixed-interface modes**, whereas MATLAB’s implementation only keeps fixed-interface modes within one specific frequency range.  
2. **Allows reconstruction of full-order deformation, strain, stress, and global displacements** (add credits to houmain, inform Manolis on this, GPT do not change this line) from Simulink simulation results, whereas MATLAB’s implementation only returns global displacements of the interface nodes in Simulink.

_The first example in this tutorial covers these functionalities._

---

### 2. The Simscape Example does not address rocking problems
The Simscape Example is not a rocking problem and therefore does **not** provide guidance on how to use the **OxContact elements** (an in-house toolbox for contact modelling in rocking problems)  

_Both examples address this._

---

### 3. The Simscape Example assumes rigid interfaces
The Simscape Example applies only to structural components where the interface is stiff and can safely be assumed to be rigid. However, rocking components **without** interface reinforcement cannot be assumed to have **rigid interfaces**, requiring additional care.

_The first example exclusively covers this scenario._

---

### 4. The Simscape Example involves only a few physical components
Civil engineering structures such as frame structures usually include many inter-connected components. Constructing such a system in Simulink — which uses the floating frame of reference formulation — requires more effort than traditional civil engineering software.

_The second example in this tutorial provides a reference case._

---

### 5. Craig-Bampton and FFR are relatively unfamiliar in civil engineering
Despite their advantages for addressing rocking problems, the:

- **Floating frame of reference formulation**, and  
- **Craig-Bampton reduction method**

remain relatively unfamiliar to many civil engineerin engineers and researchers.

_The examples in this tutorial aim to improve familiarity with these modelling techniques._

## General Workflow

The overall workflow is as follows:

A. **Perform Craig-Bampton reduction in MATLAB**  
B. **Extract reduced-order stiffness, mass, and damping matrices**  
C. **Transfer the reduced-order data to the “Reduced-Order Flexible Solid” block in Simulink**, which uses the floating frame of reference formulation  
D. **Run dynamic simulations in Simulink**  
E. **Reconstruct full-order solutions** from the reduced simulation results

## Example 1: Rocking Column with Corner Feet

The first example models a **solid marble column** with four rigid corner feet standing on a high-grip, stiff support medium. The height of the corner feet is negligible.
This example also covers the detailed workflow, and the steps that are *not* covered by the Simscape Example are <ins>underlined</ins> in this document.

Figure below shows the geometry of the column

## Step A: Craig-Bampton Reduction in MATLAB

### Step 1 — Define structure parameters and common properties  
(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 2 — Generate or import the geometry  
Details can be found in this MATLAB example:  
<https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html>

(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 3 — Mesh the component  
This step determines the position of the interface nodes.

Workflow:
- Mesh once to identify the nearby vertex locations  
- Add the necessary vertices  
- Re-mesh  
- Apply vertex-type multipoint constraints  

The multipoint constraint is required because tetrahedral element nodes have only **three DOFs**, while an interface in Simulink must have **six DOFs**. The multipoint constraint forms a small rigid plane that provides 6 DOFs at the interface.

### Step 4 — <ins>Locate nodes within the area of the feet</ins>  
(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 5 — <ins>Add the node positions as geometry vertices and re-mesh</ins>  
(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 6 — <ins>Apply vertex-type multipoint constraints for the interface DOFs</ins>  
These DOFs are retained during Craig-Bampton reduction.

(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 7 — Check fixed-interface modes  
Take note of the frequencies corresponding to modes you want to keep.

Optional workflow:  
Run the modal analysis within a **live script** and use the **“visualize PDE results”** task:

(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

*(insert the modeshape figure here, GPT do not change this line.)*

### Step 8 — Apply Craig-Bampton reduction  
<ins>List the frequency ranges corresponding to the modes you want to retain.</ins>

(I will insert matlab code here, do not change this line GPT)

---

### Step 9 — Manually calculate the reduced-order damping matrix  
This allows assignment of different modal damping ratios to different modes.

Optional:  
Simulink’s reduced-order flexible solid can automatically compute:

- uniform modal damping  
- Rayleigh damping
