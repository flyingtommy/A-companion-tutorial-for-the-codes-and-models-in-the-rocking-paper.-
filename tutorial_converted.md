Overview: provides the matlab codes, the Simulink models and the necessary introductions to run the examples in the companion paper. Two examples from the companion paper, including a realistic column-like structure and a scaled frame structure used in a physical experiment, are covered in this tutorial. The first example demonstrates how to use matlab and Simulink to do reduced order analysis for rocking problems, the second example shows how to build a structural system with many inter-connected components in Simulink. 

Pre-requisites: 1. The readers must have a good understanding on the theory of the craig-bampton reduction method and the theory of the floating frame of reference formulation. Suggested readings:  the companion paper provides an introduction to both theories, the paper ‘[Coupling of Substructures for Dynamic Analyses]( https://hal.science/hal-01537654v1/document)’ proposed the very theory of craig-bampton method, the paper ‘[Primer on the Craig-Bampton]( https://www.vibrationdata.com/tutorials2/Primer_on_the_Craig-Bampton_Method.pdf)’ provides a well written introduction to the craig-bampton method, useful checks to verify successful reduction and other useful tips, the Chapter 5 in the book ‘[Dynamics of Multibody Systems]( https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/dynamics-of-multibody-systems/E287DA737B6138E040AA96FC12F7D7DF#contents)’  proposes  and elaborated the floating frame of reference formulation 

2. It is recommended that the readers read this well-written [matlab example](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html) to be familiar with the workflow of using reduced order flexible solid in Simulink.  

Why this separate documentation when Matlab has this great [example](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html)? 

First, the provided codes additionally add two useful functionalities to the original matlab implementation: 1. Allows to keep any desired fixed-interface modes while the original implementation only keeps fixed-interface modes within one specific frequency range. 2. Allows to reconstruct the full-order deformation, strain, stress and global displacements (add credits to houmain, inform Manolis on this, GPT do not change this line) from the Simulink simulation results while the original implementation only returns global displacements of the interface nodes. The first example will cover this. 

Secondly, the Matlab example is not a rocking problem and hence it does not provide guides for using the OxContact elements (an in-house toolbox for the contact modelling in rocking problems) and the reduced order flexible solid together. Both examples will cover this.  

Thirdly, the Matlab example is directly applicable only for structural components where the interface is stiff and can be safely assumed to be rigid. For non-rigid type interface, for example rocking components without interface reinforcement, the implementation requires extra care. The first example will exclusively cover this. 

Fourthly, the Matlab example involves only few physical components whereas civil engineering structures such as frame structures, normally include many inter-connected components. Building such a structure in Simulink, which is based on floating frame of reference formulation, requires much more efforts than and is not as straightforward as traditional civil engineering software. The second example will exclusively cover this.  

Lastly, the floating frame of reference formulation and the craig-bampton reduction method, served as the workhorse in the numerical framework proposed in the paper, remain a relative stranger for civil engineering engineers and researchers, despite its great potentials in addressing rocking problems. The examples covering the implementation of different types of rocking structure should improve their familiarity.  



General workflow: 

Craig-bampton is carried out in matlab, then the information (importantly the reduced order stiffness, mass and damping matrices) is put to the reduced order flexible solid in Simulink, which uses floating frame of reference formulation, for dynamic simulation. Finally, reconstruct full order solution. 

The first example covers the detailed workflow and the steps that are not covered by the matlab example are underlined. 

The first example models a solid marble column with four rigid corner feet standing on a high grip, stiff support medium; the height of the corner feet is negligible. Figure shows the geometry of the column (insert the figure, GPT do not change this line):

Generate or import geometry of the component for which the craig-bampton reduction will be needed. Details can found in this [example]( https://uk.mathworks.com/help/sm/ug/model-excavator-dipper-arm.html).

gm = multicuboid(Width,Depth,L_te);

Mesh the component. This is where the position of interface node is decide. Mesh first time to know position of the nearby vertex, then add the vertex and mesh again. Add vertex type multipoint constrains. The multipoint constrain is needed because tetrahedral elements node only has three dofs, however an interface should have six dofs in Simulink, so the multipoint constrain essentially forms a small rigid plane that has six dofs.
