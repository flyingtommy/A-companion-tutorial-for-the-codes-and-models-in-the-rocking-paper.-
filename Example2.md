## Example 2: Rocking Frame Experiment 

The second example models the experiment steel frame tested on a shake table by **[Clough and Huckelbridge](https://nehrpsearch.nist.gov/static/files/NSF/PB278769.pdf)** , which was allowed to uplift. **Figure 1** shows the tested frame. Craig-Bampton reduction was not applied to remove its effect on the response.

📌The purpose of the second example is only to provide a reference model for building a structural system with many inter-connected components, such as a frame, in Simulink. Readers can use it to build their own models or reproduce the experiment results.
